# # DFA
# 
# ## Basic Structure

#  
# A DFA is a quintuple $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$, where:
# 
# * $Q$ is a _finite nonempty_ set of states.
# 
# * $\Sigma$ is a _finite nonempty_ alphabet containing _symbols_.
# 
# * $\delta$ is a **total** 
# 	transition function, containing a set of _transitions_. The transitions take
#     a pair from $Q\times \Sigma$ and return a state in $Q$. All this is succinctly
#     captured by writing
#     $\delta: Q\times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$. 
#     
#     - Note that in mathematics, one considers all functions to tbe **total** i.e., is defined everywhere in the domain. In programming (and computability theory), often functions are not total in this sense. We will be using the CS notion of partial functions and total functions early on, so that you don't have too many surprises later on (but we will remind you the math usage which always requires total functions)
#     
#   
# * $q_0\in Q$, is _the_ initial state.
# 
# * $F\subseteq Q$ is a _finite_ (and _possibly empty_) set of
# 	final (or _accepting_) states. These are shown as double-circled nodes in the graph of a DFA. 
#  
# Some terminology:
# 
# > We call $Q$,$\Sigma$, $\delta$, $q_0$, and $F$ the **_traits_** of the DFA.
# 
# > We will call a DFA **_structurally consistent_** or simply **"consistent"** if its traits pass the aforesaid checks.
# 
# > We will call a DFA **_partially consistent_** if it meets most of the structural consistency conditions, but may be supplied a _partial_ $\delta$ function (which function totalize_dfa will be eager to make totally consistent). 
# 
# Specifically, partial consistency will include the following checks:
# 
# * $Q$ is a _finite nonempty_ set of states.
# 
# * $\Sigma$ is a _finite nonempty_ alphabet containing _symbols_.
# 
# * The supplied $\delta$ function will be checked to see if it has allowed domain and range points. 
#  - The domain points must be a subset of $Q\times \Sigma$
#  - The range points must be a subset of $Q$
#   We do no insist that the supplied $\delta$ be total.
#     
# * $q_0\in Q$, is _the_ initial state.
# 
# * $F\subseteq Q$ is a _finite_ (and _possibly empty_) set of
# 	final (or _accepting_) states.  
#     
# Also to maintain sanity with respect to our Python encoding, we assume that the user does not have a state called "BH" in their DFA, unless its Delta is already total. (BH will be used to denote black-hole states that we introduce.)

# 
# Imagine you are a doctor walking around with a new type of stethoscope called the __language stethoscope__ (LScope).

This metaphor can come in quite handy, for instance in describing DFA minimization.

# ## DFA complementation
# 
# DFA complementation works by flipping the final and non-final states. We must check that the DFA is totalized before we embark on that, as the 'black-hole' state will now become 'white-hole' (a final state from which all symbols lead back to itself).

# # DFA Minimization
# 
# This is a good juncture at which to introduce DFA minimization. 
# 
# ## Definition of DFA minimization
# 
# We define minimization only for consistent DFA.
#  
# > _A consistent DFA D is minimal if it satisfies two properties_
#  
# >  1. There should not be any unreachable states (from the start state) in it
#  
# >  2. For any pair of distinct states $(s_1,s_2)$ in $D$, we must not have the case that for all strings $s$ in $\Sigma^*$, $\hat{\delta}(s_1,s) = \hat{\delta}(s_2,s)$.
# 
# 
# Basically, we don't want useless states and redundant states. 
# 
# Minimization is achieved in two phases:
# 
# 1. Eliminate unreachable states
# 
# 2. Merge language-equivalent and redundant states. More specifically, if you apply our __language stethoscope__ LScope (mentioned in an earlier cell) to two states A and B and "hear" the same language, you can merge these states.

# ### Eliminating unreachable states

# ## DFA minimization algorithm (high level)
# 
# We now define a minimization algorithm. Here is the gist. The actual algorithm is in the code that follows.
# 
# 1. Put the states into two equivalence classes (EC):
# 
#  a. All non-final states are in one EC, say NF
#  b. All final states are in another EC, say F
#  c. We call any (sa,sb) such that sa in NF and sb in F as **zero-distinguishable** states, as 
#     a $\varepsilon$ string can distinguish sa and sb (meaning, when sa is evolved through $\varepsilon$ or $sb$ is evolved through $\varepsilon$, the resulting state is the same -- sa or sb)
#     
#      * "Evolved through" means $\hat{\delta}(sa,\varepsilon) = sa$, and similarly for sb
#      
#      * In our example DFA d34bl, IF is zero-distinguishable from all other states
#  
# 2. In general, we have $k$-distinguishable states for $k>0$ (above step discussed $k=0$ as zero-distinguishability)
# 
# 3. Split states:
#  
#  a. Take a state pair $(s_1,s_2)$ such that they are not $k$ distinguishable.
#  b. Take $c\in\Sigma$
#  c. If $\delta(s_1,c) = sn_1$ and $\delta(s_2,c) = sn_2$ and $(sn_1,sn_2)$ are $k$-distinguishable, mark $(s_1,s_2)$ as $k+1$-distinguishable. 
#  
# 4. Repeat the above process till across one sweep, the distinguishability relation does not change.
# 
# 5. Take all maximal sets of pairs of states that have not been found distinguishable yet. Pick a representative from each such maximal set. These states are in the final DFA. 
# 
# 6. Go by the state transitions of the representative states. (The remaining states in the equivalence classes are not necessary.)
# 
#   * In our example, all pairs in $\{A,A1\} \times \{B,B1\}$ will be 1-distinguishable (distinction made by $0$)
#   
#   * The final equivalence classes will be $\{IF\}$, and then $\{A,A1\}$, and $\{B,B1\}$.

# ## Code for DFA minimization
# 
# We now provide the code for DFA minimization, referring to the above narrative to keep us focused as to which part of the algorithm we are implementing.

# ### The heart of the algorithm is function fixptDist. This seeks the fixpoint (or "fixed-point") of the Dist (or Distinguishability) relation. Neat eh?
# 
# A fixpoint of a function f is a value x such that f(x) = x. In our case, the functiion in question is one that take the entire matrix (frame) and tries to spit out the next matrix (frame). When we get a matrix m such that f(m) = m, the matrix has stabilized.
# 
# In our case, we obtain a fixpoint of the function with respect to input value "ht" (hash-table) representing our matrix. We also pass along the DFA in question ("D") that is a read-only argument (to consult its transition function, etc).
# 
# See how the code speaks for itself:
# 
# * We set "changed = True" outside a while loop, and enter this loop "while changed".
# 
# * We set changed = False, hoping to get out
# 
#   - Any change-causing activity (n-distinguishability for some n) will set changed back to True
#   
#   - If not, we will "get out of the jail"
#   
#   - Termination is guaranteed. Why?
#     
#       * There are only a finite number of states
#       
#       * If we pump a long-enough string from a pair of states,
#       
#           - Clearly, it can try to meander, visiting fresh state pairs that are m-distinguishable for 
#              an m <= n (those other state pairs and their distinguishability distance
#              were generated in an earlier pass or the current pass)
#              
#       * In short, for any pair of states (p,q), there is a maximal (loop-free) string s such that 
#         $\hat{\delta}(p,s) \in F$ while $\hat{\delta}(q,s)\in (Q\setminus F)$. This is the highest the 
#         distinguishability number can get to.
#              
#            - If $s$ has a loop, there is a shorter string that establishes the distinguishability 
#               number.
#          
#          

# We now go through all aspects of the code:
# 
# * We first iterate across "kv" (key,value) pairs in ht.items(), i.e. we iterate through all 
#   the matrix entries (pairs) which are recorded in "ht" (the hash table). The value recorded is the
#   distinguishability number.
#   
# * We obtain s0 and s1, the states that this hash-table entry is modeling.
# 
# * We iterate across all $c\in\Sigma$
# 
# * We obtain the next state after sending s0 and s1 via $c$
# 
# * If we land in the same next state (ns0 == ns1), we continue (try to "get out of the jail" by not
#   resetting changed)
#   
# * If this is a visited pair (i.e. (ns0,ns1) in ht), then
# 
#   - If one is "-1" while the other is >= 0  (meaning they are distinguishable states)
#      
#        - then we set changed = True, and continue, breaking this iteration of the "for c"
#        
#        - else we examine it as pair (ns1, ns0). This is because "ht" does not store both 
#           (ns0,ns1) and (ns1,ns0). But we have to check both ways
#           
#        - we apply the same logic
#        
# * If we can find distinguishability, we increase the ht number
# 
# * else we will get out of the loop!
