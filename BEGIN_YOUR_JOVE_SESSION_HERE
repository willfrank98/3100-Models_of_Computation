Yes folks, launch your Jove notebooks in this directory (or folder).
That way you can easily navigate up/down the directory hierarchy
quite conveniently.

If you launched Jove within say "jove/", then you can't easily climb out 
of jove/ and say go into notebooks/ etc.  So don't get stuck (no big deal,
but could be a nuisance).
